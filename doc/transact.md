# Transactions in Datalevin

Datalevin relies on the transaction mechanism of the underlying key-value store,
LMDB (Lightening Memory-Mapped Database), to achieve ACID. Datalevin transaction
and LMDB transaction have an one-to-one correspondence.

In LMDB, read and write are independent and do not block each other. Read
requires a read transaction. Write requires a read-write transaction. These are
normally two different transactions.

Writes are serialized, only one thread can write at a time. When multiple
threads write concurrently to the same key, whoever writes later wins
eventually, because writes are serialized. The first write succeeds, but the
value will then be overwritten by the second write.

Reads can be concurrent. Basically each reader thread reads its own view of the
data created at the moment the read transaction starts. When read is concurrent
with write, the newly written values are invisible to the reader, because read
transaction sees a view of the database that is consistent and up to the time
when the read transaction starts, which is before the write transaction commits.

LMDB suggests that:

> Avoid long-lived transactions. Read transactions prevent reuse of pages freed
> by newer write transactions, thus the database can grow quickly. Write
> transactions prevent other write transactions, since writes are serialized.

Detailed description of Datalevin's transaction performance can be found in
[write benchmark](../benchmarks/write-bench).

## Asynchronous Transaction

By default, each write transaction in LMDB flushes to disk when it commits,
which is an expensive operation even with today's SSD disks. To improve
transaction throughput and latency, one can use asynchronous transaction
functions that automatically batch transactions together to reduce the number of
such expensive commit calls: `transact-kv-async` for KV store, `transact-async`
for Datalog store. Both return a `future`, that is only realized after the data
is flushed to disk, and they optionally take a callback function, that will only
be called after the data is flushed to disk.

`transact` function is a blocked version of `transact-async`, that will block
until the future is realized. One can call a sequence of `transact-async`,
followed by a `transact` to achieve good batching effect and deterministic commit
at the same time, for the asynchronous transactions are still committed in
order, so the last realized future indicates all the prior calls are
already committed. Or one can `deref` the future of the last asynchronous calls
manually, or put in a callback for the last call.

The batching of asynchronous transactions is adaptive to write load. The higher
the load, the bigger the batch size. Asynchronous transactions is recommended
for heavy write workload as they can increase throughput orders of magnitude
while providing low latency. See [blog
post](https://yyhh.org/blog/2025/02/achieving-high-throughput-and-low-latency-through-adaptive-asynchronous-transaction/).

It is still useful to manually batch transaction data in user code, as the
effect of auto batching and manual batching compounds. The compound batching
effect in KV transaction is more pronounced than in Datalog transaction.

## Non-durable Environment Flags

Datalevin write transactions by default are guranteed to be durable, i.e. no
risk of data loss or DB corruption in case of system crash. As mentioned above,
this fully safe durable write condition has some performance implications since
syncing to disk is expensive.

Datalevin supports some faster, albeit less durable write conditions. By passing
in some environment flags when opening the DB, or calling `set-env-flags`
function, significant write speed up can be achieved, with some caveats. The
follwing table lists these flags and their implications.

| Flags | Meaning | Speedup in Mixed Read/Write | Implications |
|----|----|----|---|
| `:nometasync` | Only sync data pages when commit, do not sync meta pages | up to 5X | Last transaction may be lost at untimely system crashes, but integrity of DB is retained |
| `:nosync` | Don't fsync when commit | 2X - 20X | OS is responsible for syncing the data. Untimely system crash may render the DB corrupted. |
| `:writemap` + `:mapasync` | Use writable memory map and asynchronous commit | 2X - 25X | Untimely system crash may render the DB corrupted; Buggy external code may accidentally overwrite DB memory; Some OS fully preallocates the disk to the specified map size. |

Here are some examples of passing the env flags:

```Clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])
(require '[datalevin.constant :as c])

;; Pass :nosync to my-kvdb KV store
(def kv-db (d/open-kv "/tmp/my-kvdb" {:flags (conj c/defaultl-env-flags :nosync))))})

;; Turn off :nosync
(d/set-env-flags kv-db [:nosync] false)

;; Set :temp? true for a KV store automaticaly adds :nosync,
;; this DB will also be deleted on graceful JVM exit.
(d/open-kv "/tmp/tmp-kvdb" {:temp? true))})

;; Pass :writemap + :mapasync to testdb Datalog store
(d/get-conn "/tmp/testdb" {}
            {:kv-opts {:flags (-> c/default-env-flags
                                  (conj :writemap)
                                  (conj :mapasync))}})

```

Setting these flags improves write speed signficantly, users can then manually
call `sync` function at appropriate time to force flusing to disk in application
code. Timely backups may also migigate some potential data loss. Combining these
techniques may achieve desirable write speed and durability trade-off.

## Explicit Synchronous Transaction

To obtain features such as compare-and-swap semantics, that is, a group of reads
and writes are treated as a single atomic action, Datalevin exposes explicit
synchronous transaction.

For key-value API, `with-transaction-kv` macro is used for explicit transaction.
`with-transaction` macro is used for Datalog API. Basically, all the code in the
body of the macros run inside a single read/write transaction with a single
thread. These work the same in all modes of Datalevin: embedded, client/server,
or babashka pod. For usage examples, see tests in `datalevin.withtxn-test` or
`datalevin.remote-withtxnkv-test`.

Rollback from within the transaction can be done with `abort-transact-kv` and
`abort-transact`.

Datalog functions such as `transact!` use `with-transaction` internally.

## Transaction Functions in Datalog Store

In addition to `with-transaction`, transaction functions can be used in Datalog
store for atomic actions. Two types of transaction functions can be used.

`:db/fn` allows stored transaction functions. Such functions need to be defined
using `inter-fn` or `definterfn`.  This is necessary in order to support
de-serialization of functions without calling Clojure `eval`. This requirement
is needed to accommodate GraalVM native image, because `eval `cannot be used in
native image, which has a closed world assumption.  This way of defining a
function is also necessary when a function needs to be passed over the wire to
server or babashka. The source code of the function will be interpreted by
[sci](https://github.com/babashka/sci) instead, so there's currently some
limitations, e.g. except for built-in ones, normal Clojure vars are not
accessible. We will address these limitations in the future.

`:db.fn/call` is another way to call a transaction function, which does not
store the function in the database, so this is usable in embedded mode, where
that function is available in user code to call and that function can be a
regular Clojure function.

For usage examples, see tests in `datalevin.test.transact`.

## Bulk Load Data into Datalog Store

### By Transaction

The most straightforward method of transacting data at a time using `transact!`
works quite well for many cases. To have higher throughput, use
`transact-async`.

Because Datalevin supports only a single write thread at a time, parallel
transactions actually slow writes down significantly due to the thread switching
overhead.

However, transacting Datalog data involves a great number of data transformation
and integrity checks, hence it can be slow. When initializing a DB with data, it
may not be necessary to pay the price of this overhead.

### By `init-db` and `fill-db`

If it is possible, a much faster way of bulk loading data into an empty DB is to
directly load a collection of prepared datoms using `init-db` function. However,
it is the caller's responsibility to ensure these datoms are correct because data
integrity checks and temporary entity ID resolution are not performed.

Similarly, `fill-db` can be used to bulk load additional collections of prepared
datoms into a DB that is not empty. The same caution on datoms preparation need
to apply.

## Transactable Entities in Datalog store

In other Datalog DBs (Datomic®, DataScript, and Datahike) `d/entity` returns a type
that errors on associative updates. This makes sense because Entity represents
a snapshot state of a DB Entity and `d/transact` demarcates transactions.
However, this API leads to a cumbersome developer experience, especially
for the removal of fields where vectors of `[:db/retract <eid> <attr> <optional eid>]`
must be used in transactions because `nil` values are not allowed.

Datalevin ships with a special Entity type that allows for associative updates
while remaining immutable until expanded during transaction time (`d/transact`).
This type works the same in either local or remote mode.

Below are some examples. Look for the `:<STAGED>` keyword in the printed entities

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])

(def db
  (-> (d/empty-db nil {:user/handle  #:db{:valueType :db.type/string
                                          :unique    :db.unique/identity}
                       :user/friends #:db{:valueType   :db.type/ref
                                          :cardinality :db.cardinality/many}})
      (d/db-with [{:user/handle  "ava"
                   :user/friends [{:user/handle "fred"}
                                  {:user/handle "jane"}]}])))

(def ava (d/entity db [:user/handle "ava"]))

(d/touch ava)
; => {:user/handle ava, :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}}, :db/id 1}
(assoc ava :user/age 42)
; => {:user/handle  ava
;     :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}},
;     :db/id        1,
;     :<STAGED>     #:user{:age [{:op :assoc} 42]}} <-- staged transaction!

(d/touch (d/entity db [:user/handle "ava"]))
; => {:user/handle ava, :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}}, :db/id 1}
; immutable! – db entity remains unchanged

(def db2 (d/db-with db [(assoc ava :user/age 42)]))

(def ava-with-age (d/entity db [:user/handle "ava"]))

(d/touch ava-with-age)
;=> {:user/handle "ava",
;    :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}},
;    :user/age 42, <-- age was transacted!
;    :db/id 1}

(def db3
  (d/db-with db2 [(-> ava-with-age
                      (update :user/age inc)
                      (d/add :user/friends {:user/handle "eve"}))]))

;; eve exists
(d/touch (d/entity db3 [:user/handle "eve"]))
;; => {:user/handle "eve", :db/id 4}

; eve is a friend of ada
(d/touch (d/entity db3 [:user/handle "ava"]))
;=> {:user/handle "ava",
;    :user/friends #{#:db{:id 4} <-- that's eve!
;                    #:db{:id 3}
;                    #:db{:id 2}},
;    :user/age 43,
;    :db/id 1}

; Oh no! That was a short-lived friendship.
; eve and ava got into an argument 😔

(def db4
  (d/db-with
    db3
    [(d/retract (d/entity db3 [:user/handle "ava"]) :user/friends [{:db/id 4}])]))

(d/touch (d/entity db4 [:user/handle "ava"]))
;=> {:user/handle "ava",
;    :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}}, ; <-- eve is not a friend anymore
;    :user/age 43,
;    :db/id 1}
```

For more examples have a look at the
[tests](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/test/datalevin/test/entity.clj#L45-L116).

This Entity API is new and can be improved. For example, it does not currently
resolve lookup refs like `[:user/handle "eve"]`. If you'd like to help, feel
