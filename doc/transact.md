# Transactions in Datalevin

Datalevin relies on the transaction mechanism of the underlying key-value store,
LMDB (Lightening Memory-Mapped Database), to achieve ACID. Datalevin transaction
and LMDB transaction have an one-to-one correspondence.

In LMDB, read and write are independent and do not block each other. Read
requires a read transaction. Write requires a read-write transaction. These are
normally two different transactions.

Writes are serialized, only one thread can write at a time. When multiple
threads write concurrently to the same key, whoever writes later wins
eventually, because writes are serialized. The first write succeeds, but the
value will then be overwritten by the second write.

Reads can be concurrent. Basically each reader thread reads its own view of the
data created at the moment the read transaction starts. When a read is concurrent
with a write, the newly written values are invisible to the reader, because read
transaction sees a view of the database that is consistent and up to the time
when the read transaction starts, which is before the write transaction commits.

LMDB suggests that:

> Avoid long-lived transactions. Read transactions prevent reuse of pages freed
> by newer write transactions, thus the database can grow quickly. Write
> transactions prevent other write transactions, since writes are serialized.

Detailed description of Datalevin's transaction performance can be found in
[write benchmark](../benchmarks/write-bench).

## Asynchronous Transaction

By default, each write transaction in LMDB flushes to disk when it commits,
which is an expensive operation even with today's SSD disks. To improve
transaction throughput and latency, one can use asynchronous transaction
functions that automatically batch transactions together to reduce the number of
such expensive commit calls: `transact-kv-async` for KV store, `transact-async`
for Datalog store. Both return a `future`, that is only realized after the data
is flushed to disk, and they optionally take a callback function, that will only
be called after the data is flushed to disk.

`transact` function is a blocked version of `transact-async`, that will block
until the future is realized. One can call a sequence of `transact-async`,
followed by a `transact` to achieve good batching effect and deterministic commit
at the same time, for the asynchronous transactions are still committed in
order, so the last realized future indicates all the prior calls are
already committed. Or one can `deref` the future of the last asynchronous calls
manually, or put in a callback for the last call.

The batching of asynchronous transactions is adaptive to write load. The higher
the load, the bigger the batch size. Asynchronous transactions is recommended
for heavy write workload as they can increase throughput orders of magnitude
while providing low latency. See [blog
post](https://yyhh.org/blog/2025/02/achieving-high-throughput-and-low-latency-through-adaptive-asynchronous-transaction/).

It is still useful to manually batch transaction data in user code, as the
effect of auto batching and manual batching compounds. The compound batching
effect in KV transaction is more pronounced than in Datalog transaction.

## WAL Transaction Mode

Datalevin also supports a write-ahead-log (WAL) transaction mode for KV
and Datalog stores. WAL mode is opt-in and is disabled by default.

Enable WAL for KV:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])

(def kv (d/open-kv "/tmp/my-kvdb" {:kv-wal? true}))
```

Enable WAL for Datalog:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])

(def conn (d/create-conn "/tmp/mydb" {} {:datalog-wal? true}))

```

In WAL mode:

* committed transactions are appended to files under `<db-dir>/wal`
* reads see recent committed writes immediately through an in-memory overlay,
  even before those writes are replayed into LMDB base pages
* replay/indexer advances the base state and prunes covered overlay entries
* on reopen, Datalevin rebuilds overlay state from un-indexed WAL records so
  committed WAL tail data remains visible
* a background WAL checkpoint runs periodically (default every 300 seconds) to
  flush indexer progress and GC old WAL segments

WAL operations exposed by the public API:

* `kv-wal-watermarks`: current committed/indexed WAL watermarks
* `flush-kv-indexer!`: replay WAL into base (optionally bounded by WAL id)
* `open-tx-log`: stream WAL transaction records
* `kv-wal-metrics`: overlay/indexer/segment metrics
* `gc-wal-segments!`: delete old fully-indexed WAL segments by retention policy

Example:

```clojure
(let [wm0 (d/kv-wal-watermarks kv)]
  ;; Replay all committed WAL records into LMDB base
  (d/flush-kv-indexer! kv)
  ;; Read WAL records after a given wal-id
  (d/open-tx-log kv (:last-indexed-wal-tx-id wm0)))
```

Useful WAL tuning options (passed via `open-kv` opts, or `:kv-opts` in Datalog):

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `:wal-sync-mode` | `:fdatasync` | WAL fsync mode: `:fsync`, `:fdatasync`, or `:none` |
| `:wal-group-commit` | `100` | Sync WAL after this many records (lower = stronger durability) |
| `:wal-group-commit-ms` | `10` | Force a WAL sync after this delay, even under low write rates |
| `:wal-meta-flush-max-txs` | `1024` | Flush durable WAL metadata after this many committed txs |
| `:wal-meta-flush-max-ms` | `100` | Max delay before flushing durable WAL metadata |
| `:wal-segment-max-bytes` | `256 MiB` | Rotate WAL segment when size threshold is reached |
| `:wal-segment-max-ms` | `300000` | Rotate WAL segment when age threshold is reached |
| `:wal-retention-bytes` | `1 GiB` | GC threshold for total WAL size |
| `:wal-retention-ms` | `7 days` | GC threshold for WAL segment age |

## Non-durable Environment Flags

Datalevin write transactions by default are guranteed to be durable, i.e. no
risk of data loss or DB corruption in case of system crash. As mentioned above,
this fully safe durable write condition has some performance implications since
syncing to disk is expensive.

Datalevin supports some faster, albeit less durable write conditions. By passing
in some environment flags when opening the DB, or calling `set-env-flags`
function, significant write speed up can be achieved, with some caveats. The
follwing table lists these flags and their implications.

| Flags | Meaning | Speedup in Mixed Read/Write | Implications |
|----|----|----|---|
| `:nometasync` | Only sync data pages when commit, do not sync meta pages | up to 5X | Last transaction may be lost at untimely system crashes, but integrity of DB is retained |
| `:nosync` | Don't fsync when commit | up to 20X | OS is responsible for syncing the data. Untimely system crash may render the DB corrupted. |
| `:writemap` + `:mapasync` | Use writable memory map and asynchronous commit | up to 25X | Untimely system crash may render the DB corrupted; Buggy external code may accidentally overwrite DB memory; Some OS fully preallocates the disk to the specified map size. |

Here are some examples of passing the env flags:

```Clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])
(require '[datalevin.constants :as c])

;; Pass :nosync to my-kvdb KV store
(def kv-db (d/open-kv "/tmp/my-kvdb" {:flags (conj c/default-env-flags :nosync))))})

;; Turn off :nosync
(d/set-env-flags kv-db [:nosync] false)

;; Set :temp? true for a KV store automaticaly adds :nosync,
;; this DB will also be deleted on graceful JVM exit.
(d/open-kv "/tmp/tmp-kvdb" {:temp? true))})

;; Pass :writemap + :mapasync to testdb Datalog store
(d/get-conn "/tmp/testdb" {}
            {:kv-opts {:flags (-> c/default-env-flags
                                  (conj :writemap)
                                  (conj :mapasync))}})

```

Setting these flags improves write speed signficantly, users can then manually
call `sync` function at appropriate time to force flusing to disk in application
code. Timely backups may also mitigate some potential data loss. Combining these
techniques may achieve desirable write speed and durability trade-off.

## Explicit Synchronous Transaction

In addition to `:db/cas` or `:db.fn/cas` transaction functions, to obtain
features such as compare-and-swap semantics, that is, a group of reads and
writes are treated as a single atomic action, Datalevin exposes explicit
synchronous transaction as another mechanism.

For key-value API, `with-transaction-kv` macro is used for explicit transaction.
`with-transaction` macro is used for Datalog API. Basically, all the code in the
body of the macros run inside a single read/write transaction with a single
thread. These work the same in all modes of Datalevin: embedded, client/server,
or babashka pod. For usage examples, see tests in `datalevin.withtxn-test` or
`datalevin.remote-withtxnkv-test`.

Rollback from within the transaction can be done with `abort-transact-kv` and
`abort-transact`.

Datalog functions such as `transact!` use `with-transaction` internally.

## Transaction Functions in Datalog Store

As mentioned above, in addition to `with-transaction`, transaction functions can
be used in Datalog store for atomic actions. In addition to `:db/cas`, two types
of customized transaction functions can be written.

`:db/fn` allows stored transaction functions. Such functions need to be defined
using `inter-fn` or `definterfn`.  This is necessary in order to support
de-serialization of functions without calling Clojure `eval`. This requirement
is needed to accommodate GraalVM native image. `eval` generates classes at
runtime, so it cannot be used in native image, which has a closed world
assumption.  This way of defining a function is also necessary when a function
needs to be passed over the wire to servers or babashka. The source code of the
function will be interpreted by [sci](https://github.com/babashka/sci) instead,
so there's currently some limitations, e.g. except for built-in ones, normal
Clojure vars are not accessible. We will address these limitations in the
future.

`:db.fn/call` is another way to call a transaction function, which does not
store the function in the database, so this is usable in embedded mode, where
that function is available in user code to call and that function can be a
regular Clojure function.

For usage examples, see tests in `datalevin.test.transact`.

## Bulk Load Data into Datalog Store

### By Transaction

The most straightforward method of transacting data at a time using `transact!`
works quite well for many cases. To have a much higher throughput, use
`transact-async` instead.

Because Datalevin supports only a single write thread at a time, parallel
transactions actually slow writes down significantly due to mutex contention and
thread switching overhead.

Transacting Datalog data involves a great number of data transformation and
integrity checks. When initializing a DB with data, it may not be necessary to
pay the price of this transaction overhead.

### By `init-db` and `fill-db`

If it is possible, a much faster way of bulk loading data into an empty DB is to
directly load a collection of prepared datoms using `init-db` function. However,
it is the caller's responsibility to ensure these datoms are correct because data
integrity checks and temporary entity ID resolution are not performed.

Similarly, `fill-db` can be used to bulk load additional collections of prepared
datoms into a DB that is not empty. The same caution on datoms preparation need
to apply.

The manual datoms prepared process is mainly about making up approximate entity
IDs, which would not be too difficult if the numbers of entities to load is
known ahead of time. See JOB benchmark to see [an
example](../benchmarks/JOB-bench/src/datalevin_bench/core.clj).

## Transactable Entities in Datalog store

In other Datalog DBs (Datomic®, DataScript, and Datahike) `d/entity` returns a type
that errors on associative updates. This makes sense because Entity represents
a snapshot state of a DB Entity and `d/transact` demarcates transactions.
However, this API leads to a cumbersome developer experience, especially
for the removal of fields where vectors of `[:db/retract <eid> <attr> <optional eid>]`
must be used in transactions because `nil` values are not allowed.

Datalevin ships with a special Entity type that allows for associative updates
while remaining immutable until expanded during transaction time (`d/transact`).
This type works the same in either local or remote mode.

Below are some examples. Look for the `:<STAGED>` keyword in the printed entities

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])

(def db
  (-> (d/empty-db nil {:user/handle  #:db{:valueType :db.type/string
                                          :unique    :db.unique/identity}
                       :user/friends #:db{:valueType   :db.type/ref
                                          :cardinality :db.cardinality/many}})
      (d/db-with [{:user/handle  "ava"
                   :user/friends [{:user/handle "fred"}
                                  {:user/handle "jane"}]}])))

(def ava (d/entity db [:user/handle "ava"]))

(d/touch ava)
; => {:user/handle ava, :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}}, :db/id 1}
(assoc ava :user/age 42)
; => {:user/handle  ava
;     :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}},
;     :db/id        1,
;     :<STAGED>     #:user{:age [{:op :assoc} 42]}} <-- staged transaction!

(d/touch (d/entity db [:user/handle "ava"]))
; => {:user/handle ava, :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}}, :db/id 1}
; immutable! – db entity remains unchanged

(def db2 (d/db-with db [(assoc ava :user/age 42)]))

(def ava-with-age (d/entity db2 [:user/handle "ava"]))

(d/touch ava-with-age)
;=> {:user/handle "ava",
;    :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}},
;    :user/age 42, <-- age was transacted!
;    :db/id 1}

(def db3
  (d/db-with db2 [(-> ava-with-age
                      (update :user/age inc)
                      (d/add :user/friends {:user/handle "eve"}))]))

;; eve exists
(d/touch (d/entity db3 [:user/handle "eve"]))
;; => {:user/handle "eve", :db/id 4}

; eve is a friend of ada
(d/touch (d/entity db3 [:user/handle "ava"]))
;=> {:user/handle "ava",
;    :user/friends #{#:db{:id 4} <-- that's eve!
;                    #:db{:id 3}
;                    #:db{:id 2}},
;    :user/age 43,
;    :db/id 1}

; Oh no! That was a short-lived friendship.
; eve and ava got into an argument 😔

(def db4
  (d/db-with
    db3
    [(d/retract (d/entity db3 [:user/handle "ava"]) :user/friends [{:db/id 4}])]))

(d/touch (d/entity db4 [:user/handle "ava"]))
;=> {:user/handle "ava",
;    :user/friends #{#:db{:id 3} #:db{:id 2}}, ; <-- eve is not a friend anymore
;    :user/age 43,
;    :db/id 1}
```

For more examples have a look at the
[tests](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/test/datalevin/test/entity.clj#L45-L116).

This Entity API is new and can be improved. For example, it does not currently
resolve lookup refs like `[:user/handle "eve"]`. If you'd like to help, feel
