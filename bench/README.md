# Benchmark

This contains the original benchmarks from [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), with code for Datalevin added.

To run the benchmarks, you need to have the [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) installed on your system already. Then simply run this command in the bench directory.

```
./bench.clj
```

Some of the benchmarks are commented out for they take a long time to run. You can uncomment the appropriate lines in [default-benchmarks](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/bench/bench.clj#L112) in `bench.clj` to run them.
