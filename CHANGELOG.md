# Change Log

## WIP

### Changed
- [KV] KV storage is now [DLMDB](https://github.com/huahaiy/dlmdb), which has
  additional features of counted DB
  [#337](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/337), prefix compression
  and dupsort iterator optimizations.
- [KV] Default Env flag is now `#{:nordahead}`
- [KV] Default DBI flag is now `#{:create :counted :prefix-compression}`
- [KV] Default `:max-readers` is now 1024.
- [Datalog] Removed VAE index. This may reduce DB size by 30% and cut write time
  by 50% for datasets with heavy `:db.type/ref` presence (e.g. JOB benchmark
  DB). VAE was only used in entity retraction and current replacement is less
  than 10% slower.
- [Platform] Native dependencies are mostly statically compiled and bundled in the
  release jars (with exception of libc, as glibc is much faster than musl).
- [Platform] Drop support for Intel macOS.
- [Platform] Minimal Java version is now 21.

### Added
- [Platform] Automatically upgrade DB from version 0.9.27 onwards when opening
  the DB. The migration may take a while, and it needs Internet access to
  download old uberjar. [#276](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/276)
- [KV] TTL support: in `:put` transaction vector, append an optional
  `:expire-at` value to make the value expiring at the given Unix epoch
  timestamp.
- [KV] `:default-ttl-ms` option for `open-dbi` to give a default TTL for
  values of the DBI, default is `0`, means "no expiration".
- [KV] `:ttl-sweep-interval` and `:ttl-sweep-batch` options for `open-kv` to
  control the background TTL sweeper.
- [Datalog] Allow `:db/expire-at` attribute for an entity, which retracts the
  entity at the given Unix epoch timestamp.
- [KV] Random access and rank lookup functions in O(log n) time for
  `:counted` DBIs.
- [KV] Range count functions in O(log n) time for `:counted` DBIs.
- [KV] Sampling functions in O(log n) time for `:counted` DBIs.
  [#325](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/325)
- [KV] DB wide option `:key-compress :hu`, which compresses keys with
  order preserving Hu-Tucker coding. This also applies to DUPSORT values if
  enabled. Turning on the option does not have immediate effect, as `re-index`
  is needed to re-encode the data. In addition, DB needs to have enough data (>
  64K entries) to train the compressor.
- [KV] DB wide option `:val-compress :zstd`, which compresses values with
  Zstd compression. Same as above, effective after `re-index` and with
  enough data to train.

### Fixed
- [KV] Enable virtual threads usage by not reusing read only transactions
  [#326](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/326).
- [Server] Segfault due to sampler reading a closed DB.
  [#347](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/347)
- [Server] Faster code path for `pull` and `pull-many` on server
  [#322](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/322).

### Improved
- [Datalog] Smaller DB size due to VAE index removal, prefix compression, and
  key/value compression.
- [Datalog] Cut query planning time in half due to faster range counting and
  sampling of DLMDB.
- [Datalog] Reduced query execution time due to more optimized DLMDB iterators.
  Now 2X faster than PostgreSQL in JOB benchmark.

## 0.9.27 (2025-11-19)

## Added
- [KV] Write a `VERSION` file, otherwise the same as 0.9.22. This is to allow
  automatic migration from 0.9.27 to 0.10.0 and onwards.

## 0.9.22 (2025-03-18)

### Changed
- [Platform] Update minimal version of Java to 17.

### Improved
- [Vector] Defer closing of vector indices until after async executor is
  shutdown to avoid segment fault due to trying to save a closed index.

## 0.9.21 (2025-03-18)

### Added
- [Vector] `new-vector-index` function creates an on-disk index for equal-length
  dense numeric vectors to allow similarity search, and related functions
  `close-vector-index`, `clear-vector-index` and `vector-index-info`. Vector
  indexing is implemented with [usearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch).
- [Vector] Corresponding `add-vec`, `remove-vec`, and `search-vec` functions to
  work with vector index. Similar to full-text search, vector search also
  support domain semantics to allow grouping of vectors into domains.
- [Doc] [Vector doc](doc/vector.md). **Note**, you may need to install some
  native dependencies on your system to load Datalevin: OpenMP and Vector Math.
- [Datalog] New data type `:db.type/vec`, for which a vector index is
  automatically created for them to allow a query function `vec-neighbors` to
  return the datoms with neighboring vector values.
  [#145](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/145)

###  Fixed
- [Datalog] Handle pathological case of redundant clauses about the same
  attribute. [#319](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/319)
- [Datalog] Correctly handle certain case of attribute without value.
  [#320](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/320)

### Improved
- [Datalog] Limit the time for counting datoms during planning with a dynamic
  var `datalevin.constants/range-count-time-budget` in milliseconds, default
  is 10; another dynamic var `datalevin.constants/range-count-iteration-step`
  determines after how many loop iterations to take a time measure, default
  is 1000.
- [Datalog] Same for sampling with `sample-time-budget` and
  `sample-iteratioin-step`, defaults are 2 milliseconds and 20000, respectively.
- [Datalog] Reduce the exhaustive plan space to P(n, 2).
- [Datalog] Add `:parsing-time` for query parsing and `:building-time` for query
  graph building to `explain` results.
- [Search] Dump data to file when `re-index` to save memory.
- [KV] Periodically flush to disk, with an interval set by dynamic var
  `datalevin.constants/lmdb-sync-interval` in seconds, default is 300. This also
  cleans up dead readers.
- [KV] Remove the semaphore for preventing "Environment maxreaders limit
  reached" error, as it hurts read performance. User should be careful with
  functions such as `pmap` and `future`for parallel read operation, as they use
  unbounded thread pools. User can use a semaphore to limit the number of read
  threads in flight, or use a bounded thread pool. If needed, `:max-readers` KV
  option can also be set to increase the limit (default is now doubled to
  256).
- [Doc] Add `built-ins` namespace for query functions to cljdoc.

## 0.9.20 (2025-02-19)

### Improved
- [Datalog] Able to disable background sampling.

## 0.9.19 (2025-02-19)

### Added
- [Search] Boolean search expression.
  [#104](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/104)
  [#310](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/310)
- [Search] Phrase search. [#311](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/311)
- [Datalog] `analyze` function to collect statistics that helps with query
  planner.
- [Datalog] `max-eid` function to return the current maximal entity id.
- [Benchmark] [write-bench](benchmarks/write-bench) that compares Datalevin with
  SQLite on transaction performance, and studies Datalevin KV write
  performance under various conditions.

### Fixed
- [Datalog] `and` in `or-join` exception
  [#304](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/304)
- [Datalog] `and` join exception.
  [#305](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/305)
- [Datalog] Validation of negative doubles
  [#308](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/308)
- [Datalog] `seek-datom` and `rseek-datom` broken for `:eav` index

### Improved
- [Datalog] `fill-db` no longer creates a new DB, to reduce chance of user
  errors. [#306](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/306)
- [Datalog] Added arity to `seek-datoms` and `rseek-datoms` to specify the
  number of datoms desired. [Thx @jeremy302]
  [#312](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/312)
- [Datalog] `datoms` function takes an extra `n` argument as well.
- [Datalog] Faster attribute size count by selecting different counters based on
  cardinality.
- [Datalog] Sort by cardinality when picking minimal attribute.
- [KV] Prevent "MDB_READERS_FULL: Environment maxreaders limit reached" error
  when running hundreds of concurrent reading threads.
- [Async] Resepct individual callback of each async call.

## 0.9.18 (2025-01-20)

### Added
- [KV] `set-env-flags` and `get-env-flags`, so users may change the env flags
  after the DB is open. This is useful for adjusting transaction durability
  settings on the fly.

### Fixed
- [Platform] Clojure compiler adds `java.util.SequencedCollection` automatically
  when compiled on JDK 21 and above, which does not exist in earlier JDK.
  Compile library with JDK 17 instead.
- [KV] Type validation and coercion for `:bytes`.

### Improved
- [Feature] Streamline async transactions so it respects env flags.
- [Datalog] Reduce default sample change ratio to `0.05`.

## 0.9.17 (2025-01-17)

### Improved
- [Doc] Remove test namespaces from cljdoc.

## 0.9.16 (2025-01-17)

### Changed
- [Platform] Drop Java 8 support. Minimum JVM is now 11.

### Improved
- [Doc] Fix cljdoc build.
- [Package] Exclude tests, test data, Java source files from releases.

## 0.9.15 (2025-01-17)

### Added
- [KV] `transanct-kv-async` function to return a future and transact in batches
  to enhance write throughput (2.5X or more higher throughput in heavy write
  condition compared with `transact-kv`). Batch size is automatically adjusted
  to the write workload: the higher the load, the larger the batch. Howver,
  manual batching of transaction data is still helpful, as the effects of
  automatic batching and manual batching add up.
  [#256](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/256)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Upsert fails on entity with unique composite tuple
  [#299](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/299)

### Improved
- [Datalog] Both `transact` and `transact-async` are also changed to use the
  same adaptive batching transaction mechanism to enhance write throughout.
- [Datalog] Reduce default `sample-processing-interval` to 10 seconds, so
  samples are more up to date. Each invocation will do less work, or no work
  , based on a change ratio, controlled by a dynamic var `sample-change-ratio`,
  default is `0.1`, i.e. resample if 10 percent of an attribute's values
  changed.
- [Datalog] Port applicable fixes from Datascript up to 1.7.4.
- [KV] Consolidated LMDB bindings to a single binding using JavaCPP. Removed
  both LMDBJava and Graalvm native image specific bindings. This eases
  maintenance, enhances performance, and makes it easier to add native
  dependencies. [#35](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/35).
- [KV] Pushed all LMDB iterators, counters, sampler, and comparator
  implementation down to C code.
  [#279](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/279).
- [KV] Now it is optional to add `--add-opens` JVM options to open modules for
  Java 11 and above. If these JVM options are not set, Datalevin will use a
  safer but slower default option instead of throwing exceptions. It is still
  recommended to add these JVM options to get optimal performance. For now,
  native image uses only the safer option.
- [Native] Datalevin library jar can now be used directly to compile GraalVM
  native image. There's no longer a need for a GraalVM specific Datalevin
  library, nor GraalVM version restriction.
- [Native] Upgrade to the latest version of GraalVM .
- [Server] Handle rare cases of exceptions in event loop.

## 0.9.14 (2024-11-25)

### Added
- [KV] `get-first-n` to return first `n` key-values in a key range.
- [KV] `list-range-first-n` to return first `n` key-values in a key-value range
  of a list DBI. [#298](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/298)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Exception in or-join. [#295](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/295)

### Improved
- [Datalog] Faster `init-db`, `fill-db`, `re-index` and `load` by writing in
  `:nosync` mode and syncing only at the end.
- [Datalog] Push down nested predicates as well.
- [Datalog] Remove `c/plan-space-reduction-threshold`, always use `P(n, 3)`
  instead, as only initial 2 joins have accurate size estimation, so larger plan
  space for later steps is not really beneficial. This change improves JOB.
- [Datalog] Many small code optimizations to improve query speed about 10%.

## 0.9.13 (2024-11-09)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Repeated cardinality many attributes for the same entity.
  [#284](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/284)
- [Datalog] Apply type coercion according to scheam to ensure correct storage of
  values. [#285](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/285)
- [Datalog] Correct query caching when referenced content may have changed.
  [#288](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/288)
  [Thx @andersmurphy]
- [Pod] Typos in search code.
  [#291](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/291)

### Improved
- [Pod] Consistent `entity` behavior in pod as in JVM.
  [#283](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/283)
- [Datalog] Allow `:offset 0`.
- [Datalog] Implement `empty` on Datom so it can be walked.
  [#286](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/286)
- [Datalog] Query functions resolve their arguments recursively.
  [#287](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/287)
- [Native] Remove `:aot` to avoid potential dependency conflict.

## 0.9.12 (2024-10-08)

### Added
- [Datalog] `:offset` and `:limit` support,
  [#126](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/126),
  [#117](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/117)
- [Datalog] `:order-by` support,
  [#116](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/116)
- [Datalog] `count-datoms` function to return the number of datoms of a pattern
- [Datalog] `cardinality` function to return the number of unique values of an
  attribute

### Improved
- [KV] Added version number to kv-info, in preparation for auto-migration.
- [Datalog] Cache query results by default, can use dynamic var `q/*cache?*` to
  turn it off.

## 0.9.11 (2024-10-04)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Empty results after querying empty database before transact. [#269](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/269)
- [Datalog] Handle multiple variables assigned to the same cardinality many
  attribute. [#272](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/272)
- [Datalog] Return maps regression. [#273](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/273)
- [Datalog] Regression in dealing with non-existent attributes. [#274](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/274)

### Changed
- [KV] Change default write option to be the safest, the same as LMDB
  defaults, i.e. synchronous flush to disk when commit.

### Added
- [KV] Expose `sync` function to force a synchronous flush to disk, useful
  when non-default flags for writes are used.
- [Pod] added `clear` to bb pod.

### Improved
- [JVM] Support Java 8 in uberjar, following Clojure supported Java version.
- [Pod] Added missing arity in `get-conn` [Thx @aldebogdanov]

## 0.9.10 (2024-08-11)
### Fixed
- [Native] compile native image with UTF-8 encoding on Arm64 Linux and Windows.

## 0.9.9 (2024-08-11)
### Added
- [Platform] native image on Arm64 Linux. [Thx @aldebogdanov]
- [Benchmark] ported Join Order Benchmark (JOB) from SQL

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Planner: nested logic predicates.
- [Datalog] Planner: multiple predicates turned ranges.
- [Datalog] Planner: missing range turned predicates.
- [Datalog] Planner: need to first try target var to find index for :ref plan.
- [Datalog] Planner: fail to unify with existing vars in certain cases. [#263](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/263)
- [Datalog] Planner: skip initial attribute when it does not have a var.
- [Datalog] Planner: target var may be already bound for link step.
- [Datalog] Planner: missing bound var in merge scan.
- [Datalog] `like` function failed to match in certain cases.
- [Datalog] `clear` function also clear the meta DBI

### Improved
- [Datalog] Planner: execute initial step if result size is small during
  planning, controlled by dynamic var `init-exec-size-threshold` (default 1000),
  above which, the same number of samples are collected instead. These
  significantly improved subsequent join size estimation, as these initial steps
  hugely impact the final plan.
- [Datalog] Planner: search full plan space initially, until the number of plans
  considered in a step reaches `plan-space-reduction-threshold` (default 990),
  then greedy search is performed in later stages, as these later ones have less
  impact on performance. This provides a good balance between planning time and
  plan quality, while avoiding potential out of memory issue during planning.
- [Datalog] Planner: do parallel processing whenever appropriate during planning
  and execution (regular JVM only).
- [LMDB] Lock env when creating a read only txn to have safer concurrent reads.

### Changed
- [Datalog] maintain an estimated total size and a representative sample of
  entity ids for each attribute, processed periodically according to
  `sample-processing-interval`(default 3600 seconds).
- [Datalog] reduce default `*fill-db-batch-size*` to 1 million datoms.
- [KV] throw exception when transacting `nil`, [#267](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/267)

## 0.9.8 (2024-06-29)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Planner: column attributes should be a set of equivalent attribute
  and variable.
- [Datalog] Planner: convert ranges back to correct predicates.
- [Datalog] Handle `like`, `in` within complex logic expressions.

### Improved
- [Datalog] Optimize `not`, `and` and `or` logic functions that involve only
  one variable.

## 0.9.7 (2024-06-23)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Handle bounded entity IDs in reverse reference and value equality
  scans, [#260](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/260)
### Improved
- [Datalog] Added `:result` to `explain` result map.

## 0.9.6 (2024-06-21)

### Added
- [Datalog] `like` function similar to LIKE operator in SQL: `(like input
  pattern)` or `(like input pattern opts)`. Match pattern accepts wildcards `%`
  and `_`. `opts` map has key `:escape` that takes an escape character, default
  is `\!`. Pattern is compiled into a finite state machine that does non-greedy
  (lazy) matching, as oppose to the default in Clojure/Java regex. This function
  is further optimized by rewritten into index scan range boundary for patterns
  that have non-wildcard prefix. Similarly, `not-like` function is provided.
- [Datalog] `in` function that is similar to IN operator in SQL: `(in input
  coll)` which is optimized as index scan boundaries. Similarly, `not-in`.
- [Datalog] `fill-db` function to bulk-load a collection of trusted datoms,
  `*fill-db-batch-size*` dynamic var to control the batch size (default 4
  million datoms). The same var also control `init-db` batch size.
- `read-csv` function, a drop-in replacement for `clojure.data.csv/read-csv`.
  This CSV parser is about 1.5X faster and is more robust in handling quoted
  content.
- Same `write-csv` for completeness.

### Fixed
- [Datalog] Wrong variable may be returned when bounded variables are
  involved. [#259](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/259)

### Changed
- [KV] Change default initial DB size to 1 GiB.

### Improved
- [Platform] Use local LMDB library on FreeBSD if available [thx
@markusalbertgraf].
- [Datalog] `min` and `max` query predicates handle all comparable data.
- [Datalog] Port applicable fixes from Datascript up to 1.7.1.
- update deps.


## 0.9.5 (2024-04-17)

### Fixed
- [Datalog] planner generates incorrect step when bound variable is involved in
  certain cases.
- [Datalog] `explain` throws when zero result is determined prior to actual
  planning. [Thx @aldebogdanov]
- [Datalog] regression in staged entity transactions for refs, [#244](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/244), [Thx @den1k]
### Improved
- [Datalog] added query graph to `explain` result map.

## 0.9.4 (2024-04-02)

### Added
- [Datalog] `explain` function to show query plan.
- [Platform] Embedded library for Linux on Aarch64, which is crossed compiled
  using zig.
### Fixed
- [KV] Broken embedded library on Windows.
### Improved
- [Datalog] more robust concurrent writes on server.
- [KV] Flags are now sets instead of vectors.
- Update deps

## 0.9.3 (2024-03-13)

[DB Upgrade](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/upgrade.md) is required.

### Added
- [Datalog] Query optimizer to improve query performance, particularly for
  complex queries. See [details](doc/query.md). [#11](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/11)
- [Datalog] More space efficient storage format, leveraging LMDB's
  dupsort feature, resulting in about 20% space reduction and faster counting of
  data entries.
- [Datalog] `search-datoms` function to lookup datoms without having to specify
  an index.
- [KV] Expose LMDB dupsort feature, i.e. B+ trees of B+ trees, [#181](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/181), as the
  following functions that work only for dbi opened with `open-list-dbi`:
    * `put-list-items`
    * `del-list-items`
    * `visit-list`
    * `get-list`
    * `list-count`
    * `key-range-list-count`
    * `in-list?`
    * `list-range`
    * `list-range-count`
    * `list-range-filter`
    * `list-range-first`
    * `list-range-some`
    * `list-range-keep`
    * `list-range-filter-count`
    * `visit-list-range`
    * `operate-list-val-range`
- [KV] `key-range` function that returns a range of keys only.
- [KV] `key-range-count` function that returns the number of keys in a range.
- [KV] `visit-key-range` function that visit keys in a range for side effects.
- [KV] `range-some` function that is similar to `some` for a given range.
- [KV] `range-keep` function that is similar to `keep` for a given range.

### Changed
- [Datalog] Change VEA index back to VAE.
- [Datalog] `:eavt`, `:avet` and `:vaet` are no longer accepted as index names,
  use `:eav`, `:ave` and `:vae` instead. Otherwise, it's misleading, as we don't
  store tx id.
- [KV] Change default write setting from `:mapasync` to `:nometasync`, so
  that the database is more crash resilient. In case of system crash, only the
  last transaction might be lost, but the database will not be corrupted. [#228](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/228)
- [KV] Upgrade LMDB to the latest version, now tracking mdb.master branch,
  as it includes important fixes for dupsort, such as
  https://bugs.openldap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9723
- [KV] `datalevin/kv-info` dbi to keep meta information about the databases, as
  well as information about each dbi, as flags, key-size, etc. [#184](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/184)
- [KV] Functions that take a predicate have a new argument `raw-pred?` to
  indicate whether the predicate takes a raw KV object (default), or a pair of
  decoded values of k and v (more convenient).

### Improved
- [Datalog] Query results is now spillable to disk. [#166](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/166)
- [Search] Functions in `search-utils` namespace are now compiled instead of
  being interpreted to improve performance.

## 0.8.29 (2024-02-23)
### Improved
- Support older Clojure version.
- [Server] Recover options after automatic reconnect. [#241](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/241)

## 0.8.28 (2024-02-23)
### Fixed
- [Datalog] Concurrent writes of large data values.
### Added
- [Datalog] `:closed-schema?` option to allow declared attributes only, default
  is `false`. [Thx @andersmurphy]
### Improved
- [Datalog] ported applicable improvements from Datascript up to 1.6.3

## 0.8.26 (2024-02-09)
### Fixed
- [Datalog] `:validate-data? true` not working for some data types. [Thx @andersmurphy]
- [Datalog] ported applicable fixes from Datascript up to 1.6.1
### Improved
- bump deps

## 0.8.25 (2023-12-14)
### Added
- [Datalog] Add `:db.fulltext/autoDomain` boolean property to attribute schema,
  default is `false`. When `true`, a search domain
  specific for this attribute will be created, with a domain name same as
  attribute name, e.g. "my/attribute". This enables the same `fulltext` function syntax as
  Datomic, i.e. `(fulltext $ :my/attribute ?search)`.
- [Search] Add `:search-opts` option to `new-search-engine` option argument,
  specifying default options passed to `search` function.

## 0.8.24 (2023-12-12)
### Added
- [Datalog] Add `:db.fulltext/domains` property to attribute schema, [#176](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/176)

- [Search] `:proximity-max-dist` search option (default `45`) can be used to
  control the maximal distance between terms that would still be considered as
  belonging to the same span.
- [Search] `create-stemming-token-filter` function to create stemmers, which

## 0.8.13 (2023-04-28)
### Fixed
- [Datalog] Unexpected heap growth due to caching error. [#204](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/204)
- [Datalog] More cases of map size reached errors during transaction. [#196](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/196)
- [Datalog] Existing datoms still appear in `:tx-data` when unchanged. [#207](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/207)

## 0.8.10 (2023-04-01)
### Added
- [KV] `:max-readers` option to specify the maximal number of concurrent readers
  allowed for the db file. Default is 126.
- [KV] `max-dbs` option to specify the maximal number of sub-databases (DBI)
  allowed for the db file. Default is 128. It may induce slowness if too big a
  number of DBIs are created, as a linear scan is used to look up a DBI.
### Fixed
- [Datalog] `clear` after db is resized.

## 0.8.9 (2023-03-28)
### Fixed

### Improved
- [Lib] update deps.

## 0.8.5 (2023-02-13)
### Added
- [KV] added tuple data type that accepts a vector of scalar values. This
  supports range queries, i.e. having expected ordering by first element, then
  second element, and so on. This is useful, for example, as path keys for
  indexing content inside documents. When used in keys, the same 511 bytes
  limitation applies.
- [Datalog] added heterogeneous tuple `:db/tupleTypes` and homogeneous tuples
  `:db/tupleType` type. Unlike Datomic, the number of elements in a tuple are
  not limited to 8, as long as they fit inside a 496 bytes buffer. In addition,
  instead of using `nil` to indicate minimal value like in Datomic, one can use
  `:db.value/sysMin` or `:db.value/sysMax` to indicate minimal or maximal
  values, useful for range queries. [#167](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/167)

  same transaction.

## 0.8.2 (2023-01-19)
### Fixed
- [Search] `search-utils/create-ngram-token-filter` now works. [#164](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/164)
- [Datalog] large datom value may throw off full-text indexing. [#177](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/177)

## 0.8.1 (2023-01-19)
### Fixed
- [Datalog] intermittent `:db/fulltext` values transaction error. [#177](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/177)

## 0.8.0 (2023-01-19)

[DB Upgrade](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/upgrade.md) is required.

### Changed
- [Search] **Breaking** search index storage format change. Data re-indexing is
  necessary.
### Improved
- [Search] significant indexing speed and space usage improvement: for default
  setting, 5X faster bulk load speed; 2 orders of magnitude faster
  `remove-doc` and 10X disk space reduction; when term positions and offsets are
  indexed: 3X faster bulk load and 40 percent space reduction.
- [Search] added caching for term and document index access, resulting in 5
  percent query speed improvement on average, 35 percent improvement at median.
### Added
- [Search] `:index-position?` option to indicate whether to record term
  positions inside documents, default `false`.
- [Search] `:check-exist?` argument to `add-doc`indicate whether to check the
  existence of the document in the index, default `true`. Set it to `false` when
  importing data to improve ingestion speed.
### Fixed
- [Datalog] increasing indexing time problem for `:db/fulltext` values. [#151](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/151)
- [Search] error when indexing huge documents.
- [KV] spillable results exception in certain cases.
### Removed
- [Search] `doc-refs` function.
- [Search] `search-index-writer` as well as related `write` and
  `commit`functions for client/server, as it makes little sense to bulk load
  documents across network.

- [Native] updated to the latest Graalvm 22.3.0. [#174](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/174)

## 0.7.8 (2023-01-04)
### Fixed
- [KV] `get-range` regression when results are used in `sequence`. [#172](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/172)
### Improved

### Added
- [Platform] embedded library support for Apple Silicon.
- [KV] A new range function `range-seq` that has similar signature as
  `get-range`, but returns a `Seqable`, which lazily reads data items into
  memory in batches (controlled by `:batch-size` option). It should be used
  inside `with-open` for proper cleanup. [#108](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/108)
- [KV] The existent eager range functions, `get-range` and `range-filter`, now
  automatically spill to disk when memory pressure is high. The results, though
  mutable, still implement `IPersistentVector`, so there is no API level
  change. The spill-to-disk behavior is controlled by `spill-opts` option map
  when opening the db, allowing `:spill-threshold` and `:spill-root` options.
### Improved
- [KV] write performance improvement

### Fixed
- [KV] `with-transaction-kv` does not crash when DB is resizing.

## 0.6.26
### Added
- [KV] `with-transaction-kv` macro to expose explicit transactions for KV
  database. This allows arbitrary code within a transaction to achieve
  atomicity, e.g. to implement compare-and-swap semantics, etc, [#110](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/110)
- [Datalog] `with-transaction` macro, the same as the above for Datalog database
- [KV]`abort-transact-kv` function to rollback writes from within an explicit KV transaction.
- [Datalog] `abort-transact` function, same for Datalog transaction.
- [Pod] Missing `visit` function

  @ngrunwald)
- [Datalog] `:timeout` option to terminate on deadline for query/pull. [#150](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/150) (thx
  @cgrand).

## 0.6.19
### Changed
- [Datalog] Entity equality requires DB identity in order to better support
  reactive applications, [#146](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/146) (thx @den1k)
### Improved
- bump deps

## 0.6.18
### Fixed
- [Search] corner case of search in document collection containing only one term, [#143](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/143)
- [Datalog] entity IDs has smaller than expected range, now they cover full 32 bit integer range, [#140](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/140)

- [Datalog] Additional arity to `update-schema` to allow renaming attributes. [#131](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/131)
- [Search] `clear-docs` function to wipe out search index, as it might be faster
  to rebuild search index than updating individual documents sometimes. [#132](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/132)
- `datalevin.constants/*data-serializable-classes*` dynamic var, which can be
  used for `binding` if additional Java classes are to be serialized as part of
  the default `:data` data type. [#134](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/issues/134)
### Improved

## 0.4.0

[DB Upgrade](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/upgrade.md) is required.

### Changed
- [**Breaking**] Removed AEV index, as it is not used in query. This reduces storage
  and improves write speed.
- [**Breaking**] Change VAE index to VEA, in preparation for new query engine. Now
  all indices have the same order, just rotated, so merge join is more likely.
- [**Breaking**] Change `open-lmdb` and `close-lmdb` to `open-kv` and `close-kv`,
  `lmdb/transact` to `lmdb/transact-kv`, so they are consistent, easier to
  remember, and distinct from functions in `datalevin.core`.

### Added
- GraalVM native image specific LMDB wrapper. This wrapper allocates buffer
  memory in C and uses our own C comparator instead of doing these work in Java,
  so it is faster.
- Native command line shell, `dtlv`

## 0.3.17
### Changed
- Improve Java interop call performance

## 0.3.16
### Changed
- Allow Java interop calls in where clauses, e.g. `[(.getTime ?date) ?timestamp]`, `[(.after ?date1 ?date2)]`, where the date variables are `:db.type/instance`. [#32]

## 0.3.15
### Changed
- Changed default LMDB write behavior to use writable memory map and
  asynchronous msync, significantly improved write speed for small transactions
  (240X improvement for writing one datom at a time).

## 0.3.14
### Fixed
- Read `:db.type/instant` value as `java.util.Date`, not as `long` [#30]

## 0.3.13
### Fixed

### Changed
- Expose all data types to key-value store API [#24]

## 0.3.4
### Fixed

## 0.3.3
### Fixed
- Properly initialize max-eid in `core/empty-db`

## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

### Changed
- [**Breaking**] Change argument order of `core/create-conn`, `db/empty-db`
  etc., and put `dir` in front, since it is more likely to be specified than
  `schema` in real use, so users don't have to put `nil` for `schema`.

## 0.2.19
### Fixed
- correct `core/update-schema`

## 0.2.18

### Fixed
- correctly handle `false` value as `:data`
- always clear buffer before putting data in

### Fixed
- long out of range error during native compile

## 0.2.2
### Changed
- apply [query/join-tuples optimization](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/pull/203)
- use array get wherenever we can in query, saw significant improvement in some queries.
- use `db/-first` instead of `(first (db/-datom ..))`, `db/-populated?` instead of `(not-empty (db/-datoms ..)`, as they do not realize the results hence faster.
