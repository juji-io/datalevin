> I love Datalog, why hasn't everyone used this already?

Datalevin is a simple durable [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
database. Here's what a Datalog query looks like in Datalevin:

```Clojure
(d/q '[:find  ?name ?total
       :in    $ ?year
       :where [?sales :sales/year ?year]
              [?sales :sales/total ?total]
              [?sales :sales/customer ?customer]
              [?customer :customers/name ?name]]
      (d/db conn) 2024)
```

## :question: Why

The rationale is to have a simple, fast and open source Datalog query engine
running on durable storage.

It is our observation that many developers prefer
the flavor of Datalog popularized by [DatomicÂ®](https://www.datomic.com) over
any flavor of SQL, once they get to use it. Perhaps it is because Datalog is
more declarative and composable than SQL, e.g. the automatic implicit joins seem
to be its killer feature. In addition, the recursive rules feature of Datalog
makes it suitable for graph processing and deductive reasoning.

The feature set of DatomicÂ® may not be a good fit for some use cases. One thing
that may [confuse some
users](https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/posts/2017-07-08-Datomic-this-is-not-the-history-youre-looking-for.html)
is its [temporal
features](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#time-model). To
keep things simple and familiar, Datalevin behaves the same way as most other
databases: when data are deleted, they are gone. Datalevin also follows the
widely accepted principles of ACID, instead of introducing [unusual
semantics](https://jepsen.io/analyses/datomic-pro-1.0.7075).

In addition to support DatomicÂ® flavor of Datalog query language, Datalevin has
a [novel cost-based query optimizer](doc/query.md) with a much better query
performance, which is [competitive](benchmarks/JOB-bench) with popular SQL RDBMS
such as PostgreSQL.

Datalevin provides robust ACID transaction features on the basis of
[LMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database), known
for its high read performance. With built-in support of asynchronous
transaction, Datalevin can also handle [write](benchmarks/write-bench) intensive
workload, as well as storing large documents.

Datalevin supports [vector database](doc/vector.md) features by integrating an
efficient SIMD accelerated vector indexing and search
[library](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch).

Datalevin has a [novel full-text search engine](doc/search.md) that has
[competitive](benchmarks/search-bench) search performance.

Datalevin can be used as a fast key-value store for
[EDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Data_Notation) data. The native
EDN data capability of Datalevin should be beneficial for Clojure programs.

Datalevin can be used as a library, embedded in applications to manage state,
e.g. used like SQLite; or it can run in a networked
[client/server](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/server.md)
mode (default port is 8898) with full-fledged role-based access control (RBAC)
on the server, e.g. used like PostgreSQL; or it can be used as a [babashka
pod](https://github.com/babashka/pod-registry/blob/master/examples/datalevin.clj)
for shell scripting.

## :tada: Usage

Datalevin is aimed to be a versatile database.

### Use as a Datalog store

In addition to [our API doc](https://cljdoc.org/d/datalevin/datalevin),
Datalevin has almost the same Datalog API as
[Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), which in turn has almost the
same API as DatomicÂ®, please consult the abundant tutorials, guides and learning
sites available online to learn about the usage of DatomicÂ® flavor of Datalog.

Here is a simple code example using Datalevin:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])

;; Define an optional schema.
;; Note that pre-defined schema is optional, as Datalevin does schema-on-write.
;; However, attributes requiring special handling need to be defined in schema,
;; e.g. range query, many cardinality, uniqueness, reference type, etc.
;; Similar to Datascript, Datalevin schemas differ from DatomicÂ®:
;; - The schema must be a map of maps, not a vector of maps.
;; - It is not `transact`ed into the db but passed when acquiring connections.
;; - Use `update-schema` to update the schema of an open connection to a DB.
(def schema {:aka  {:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many}
             ;; :db/valueType is optional, if unspecified, the attribute will be
             ;; treated as EDN blobs, and may not be optimal for range queries
             :name {:db/valueType :db.type/string
                    :db/unique    :db.unique/identity}})

;; Create DB on disk and connect to it, assume write permission to create the dir
(def conn (d/get-conn "/tmp/datalevin/mydb" schema))
;; or if you have a Datalevin server running on myhost with default port 8898
;; (def conn (d/get-conn "dtlv://myname:mypasswd@myhost/mydb" schema))

;; Transact some data
;; `:nation` is not defined in schema, so it will be treated as an EDN blob
(d/transact! conn
            [{:name "Frege", :db/id -1, :nation "France", :aka ["foo" "fred"]}
             {:name "Peirce", :db/id -2, :nation "france"}
             {:name "De Morgan", :db/id -3, :nation "English"}])

;; Query the data
(d/q '[:find ?nation
       :in $ ?alias
       :where
       [?e :aka ?alias]
       [?e :nation ?nation]]
     (d/db conn)
     "fred")
;; => #{["France"]}

;; Retract the name attribute of an entity
(d/transact! conn [[:db/retract 1 :name "Frege"]])

;; Pull the entity, now the name is gone
(d/q '[:find (pull ?e [*])
       :in $ ?alias
       :where
       [?e :aka ?alias]]
     (d/db conn)
     "fred")
;; => ([{:db/id 1, :aka ["foo" "fred"], :nation "France"}])

;; Close DB connection
(d/close conn)
```

### Use as a key-value store

Datalevin packages the underlying LMDB database as a convenient key-value store
for EDN data.

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])
(import '[java.util Date])

;; Open a key value DB on disk and get the DB handle
(def db (d/open-kv "/tmp/datalevin/mykvdb"))
;; or if you have a Datalevin server running on myhost with default port 8898
;; (def db (d/open-kv "dtlv://myname:mypasswd@myhost/mykvdb" schema))

;; Define some table (called "dbi", or sub-databases in LMDB) names
(def misc-table "misc-test-table")
(def date-table "date-test-table")

;; Open the tables
(d/open-dbi db misc-table)
(d/open-dbi db date-table)

;; Transact some data, a transaction can put data into multiple tables
;; Optionally, data type can be specified to help with range query
(d/transact-kv
  db
  [[:put misc-table :datalevin "Hello, world!"]
   [:put misc-table 42 {:saying "So Long, and thanks for all the fish"
                        :source "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"}]
   [:put date-table #inst "1991-12-25" "USSR broke apart" :instant]
   [:put date-table #inst "1989-11-09" "The fall of the Berlin Wall" :instant]])

;; Get the value with the key
(d/get-value db misc-table :datalevin)
;; => "Hello, world!"
(d/get-value db misc-table 42)
;; => {:saying "So Long, and thanks for all the fish",
;;     :source "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"}


;; Range query, from unix epoch time to now
(d/get-range db date-table [:closed (Date. 0) (Date.)] :instant)
;; => [[#inst "1989-11-09T00:00:00.000-00:00" "The fall of the Berlin Wall"]
;;     [#inst "1991-12-25T00:00:00.000-00:00" "USSR broke apart"]]

;; This returns a PersistentVector - e.g. reads all data in JVM memory
(d/get-range db misc-table [:all])
;; => [[42 {:saying "So Long, and thanks for all the fish",
;;          :source "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"}]
;;     [:datalevin "Hello, world!"]]

;; This allows you to iterate over all DB keys inside a transaction.
;; You can perform writes inside the transaction.
;; Avoid long-lived transactions. Read transactions prevent reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the database can grow quickly.
;; Write transactions prevent other write transactions, since writes are serialized.
(d/visit db misc-table
            (fn [kv]
               (let [k (d/read-buffer (d/k kv) :data)]
                  (when (= k 42)
                    (d/transact-kv db [[:put misc-table 42 "Don't panic"]]))))
              [:all])

(d/get-range db misc-table [:all])
;; => [[42 "Don't panic"] [:datalevin "Hello, world!"]]

;; Delete some data
(d/transact-kv db [[:del misc-table 42]])

;; Now it's gone
(d/get-value db misc-table 42)
;; => nil

;; Close key value db
(d/close-kv db)
```
## :green_book: Documentation

Please refer to the [API
documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/datalevin/datalevin) for more details.

## :rocket: Status

Datalevin is extensively tested with property-based testing. It is also used
in production at [Juji](https://juji.io), among other companies.

Running the [benchmark suite adopted from
Datascript](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/tree/master/benchmarks/datascript-bench),
which includes several queries on 100K random datoms, on a 2016 Ubuntu Linux server with an Intel i7 3.6GHz CPU and a 1TB SSD drive, here is how it looks.

<p align="center">
<img src="benchmarks/datascript-bench/Read.png" alt="query benchmark" height="300"></img>
</p>

In all benchmarked queries, Datalevin is the fastest among the three tested
systems, as Datalevin has a [cost based query optimizer](doc/query.md) while Datascript and
Datomic do not. Datalevin also has a caching layer for index access. See
[here](benchmarks/datascript-bench) for a detailed analysis of the results.

We also compared Datalevin and PostgreSQL in handling complex queries, using
[Join Order Benchmark](benchmarks/JOB-bench). On a
MacBook Pro, Apple M3 chip with 12 cores, 30 GB memory and 1TB SSD drive, here's
the average times:

<p align="center">
<img src="benchmarks/JOB-bench/means.png" alt="JOB benchmark averages" height="300"></img>
</p>

Datalevin is about 1.3X faster than PostgreSQL on average in running the complex
queries that involves many joins. The gain is mainly due to shorter query
execution time as Datalevin's query optimizer generates better plans. Details of
the analysis can be found in [this
article](https://yyhh.org/blog/2024/09/competing-for-the-job-with-a-triplestore/)

For durable transaction performance, we compared Datalevin with
SQLite using [this write benchmark](benchmark/write-bench) on a 2016 Ubuntu Linux server with an Intel i7 3.6GHz CPU and a 1TB SSD drive.

<p align="center">
<img src="benchmarks/write-bench/throughput-1.png" alt="Throughput at 1" height="300"></img>
</p>

When transacting one entity (equivalently, one row in SQLite) at a time,
Datalevin's default transaction function is over 5X faster than SQLite's
default; while Datlevin's asynchronous transaction mode is over 20X faster than
SQLite's WAL mode.

On the other hand, when transacting ever larger number of entities (rows) at a
time, SQLite gains on Datalevin and eventually surpasses it. For bulk loading
data, it is recommended to use `init-db` and `fill-db` functions, instead of
doing transactions in Datalevin. See [transaction](doc/transact.md) for more
discussions.
